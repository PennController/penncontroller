- PRIORITY: investigate resource preloading (esp. with zip files)!!
- Resize the Video element's disable overlay when the video is resized (even after print)
- Elements keep absolute position when printing them without arguments after printing them with coordinates
- Scaled elements do not occupy the flow normally (they occupy their original size)
- Elements in after/before do not get printed if those are called after print

- "Reach trial" won't work because of a log command that fails with this mousetracking experiment:
    https://farm.pcibex.net/experiments/cOTofa/edit
- Revise Selector's frame to use printAndRefresh? 
    > or just getBoundingRect in requestAnimationFrame
- Audio resource's object would never get created, and value would always remain as blob:url
    when the same audio file was referenced in multiple rows/trials in a Template command
    (and the audio files are part of a zip file)
- Global Var handling got messy again...
    > creating newVar it in Template is executed *AFTER* in newTrial
    > .value in general acts weird ("command 0 unknown")
    > eg. newText().text( getTextInput() ) should work (it doesn't) < should it?

- Go through command arguments not being executed as commands
    > serious problems with .value and recursion?
- Make .text a standard command < ? maybe with jQuery().text()?
- Do something about new* in callbacks? resets properties when it shouldn't?
    >   have getOrNew? or just no new/get prefix?


- Throw an error when .log(.,.) is not called on newTrial() < not feasible just by looking # of arguments


- ? Double-check pointers to elements as Var values (re-evaluted whenever .value is accessed?) < works as far as I can tell

- ??? Check that "speeded acceptability" does record every word for DashedSentence

- Something weird with newX().selector() (error message: "already in selector") < ? I don't know

- Fix clear(): crash with unnamed elements < ? not anymore?


- Add "local" to eyetracker's upload URL < that's for the farm

- Write documentation about test commands (conditionals and operators) and good practice on how to inject native javascript



- canvas.add should not reprint the canvas (messes with order)      < FIXED?


Since 2.0
- Audio reload: https://farm.pcibex.net/r/xZjuCE/
- Add a 'Warning' tab?
    > many problems with duplicates (elements sharing the same name)
    > throw warning when callback comes after wait
    > throw warnings/errors when no 'stop' command for relevant elements
- Selector shuffle with before/after elements doesn't work
- Flickering on Chrome with .scaling("page")
- Add .nolog or something to trials to skip 'start' and 'end' events
- Fix self in chained self's (or just in .and?)
- InititateRecorder no longer detects video only for MediaRecorder("video")? < It does, but it must be "video only"
- MediaRecorder.stop won't validate promise?
- Error message "Command ‘0’/‘length’/‘parentNode’ unknown on Text element" with this:
    newScale("answer2", 4)
        .vertical()
        .radio()
        .label(0, newText("waf"))
        .label(1, newText("wef"))
        .label(2, newText("wof"))
        .label(3, newText("wif"))
        .labelsPosition("right")
        .log()
        .print()
        .wait()
- Calling print with *no* arguments after calling it *with* arguments first
    wrongly keeps the absolute position
- Use conf_modifyRunningOrder to return a Proxy instance:
    > keep track of current trial's index
    > when index is incremented, insert trials into or splice the sequence if jumping earlier/later in the sequence
- Disable on audio makes the element disappear (because controls=false)
    > change behavior so that it always adds a fully transparent layer on video (controls false), semi-transparent on audio (controls true)
- Order reported in results after selector.shuffle is off 
    >   also selector.shuffle does not work with plain print() commands
    >>  solution: run the print() commands randomly rather than in order!
- Re-printing DropDown elements cancels their onchange event
- TextInput should be overwritable when all text selected

    start with the resources of the first trials to be run first
    start with zip files (already the case?)
    use callback (+ timeouts) to load next resources
- Something about Group column not accepting numbers?

            super(f());
            Object.defineProperty(this, "value", {get() { return f() }});
            this.type = "Var";
            this._promises = [];
        }
    }
    var GetGroup = () => new LazyString( ()=>Date.now() )
- Add shuffle for Scales
- Add a (Copy) Report option in the debugger, to use on the forums

KAJSA'S BUG [**FIXED**]:
    SOME ELEMENTS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SPREADSHEET HAVE DIFFERENT LABELS
    IBEX'S INTERNAL MUNGGROUP + LATINSQUARE FUNCTIONS ARE SIMILAR TO FEEDITEMS:
    THEY GROUP THE ITEMS IN AN OBJECT, INDEXING THEM BY THEIR GROUP LABEL AND THEN FLATTEN THEM INTO AN ARRAY
    PROBLEM ARISES WHEN GROUP IN FIRST ROW OF FIRST FEEDITEMS IS DIFFERENT FROM FIRST ROW OF LATER FEEDITEMS
        > THE TWO FEEDITEMS ARE NOT ORDERED IN SYNC
        > + IF GROUP LABELS OF LATER FEEDITEMS ARE INTERMEDIATE AND # OF ROW IS NOT MODULO-CONSISTENT, IT SHIFTS THE LATIN SQUARE CONF
    SOLUTION?
        MODIFY-RUNNING-ORDER?
        NEED TO KEEP TRACK OF FEEDING (NOT ALL ITEMS GENERATED BY FEEDITEMS ARE PENNCONTROLLER ITEMS)
        PRE-PARSE THE TABLE?


BUG WITH FEEDITEMS DURING RUTGERS' WORKSHOP [**FIXED**]
    >> FIX IT!!

KNOWN BUGS/ERRORS/ISSUES
    - Sometimes templates do not work?
    - No support for OGG files on Safari 12
    - PennController does not work on Safari <12
    - Chrome & Safari require an interaction before the first audio is played (newer versions)


- fix voicerecorder with Chrome
    > certificate problem, fixing requires installing a certificate (tell Alex)

- add the drag'n'drop element (but what/when to log?)


- PRIORITY NOTES:                                                               [ Not happened in a while... ]
    >   Conflict between AUDIO and IFRAME??? > Sometimes
            >> MAYBE NOT DUE TO IFRAME, BUT PROBLEM MORE GENERALLY...?

- Fix what happens when no host and no zip provided


- Mouse
    > Save mouse location on click events
    > Make it possible to save any click < in Mouse instruction?
    PennController.mouse
                .settings.record("clickLocation", "clickInstruction", "hoverLocation", "hoverInstruction")
    PennController.mouse
                .waitHover( PennController.image("imgMyImage") )
                .waitClick( PennController.image("imgMyImage") )
    PennController.mouse
                .test.hover( PennController.image("imgMyImage") )

- Add a .background method for Canvas, to specify color/image background

- Add a .smartResize method for Canvas that updates the coordinates and sizes of the elements it contains?

- Add some way to LOOP instructions?
    > In particular, trigger an instruction EACH TIME a key is pressed (t.key("FJ").whenever( t("imgBeach").hide() )

- Write the Screen Instruction to prevent added elements from showing up
    > play with the _addElementTo function

- Add a MOUSE Instruction?
        > record position

- Integrate an instruction equivalent to the DashedSentence controller?

- Add parameters to the WAIT function of AUDIO
    on playstart or playend or stop < ?





IN PROGRESS     OBSOLETE
- Add a SHUFFLE method to ComplexInstr (already implemented in selector)        < not sure it's needed
    can pass indexes/instructions as parameters
    e.g.    t( t("image1.png").id("i1"), t("image2.png").id("i2"),   t("<br>"),   t("image3.png").id("i3"), t("image4.png").id("i4") ).shuffle(t("i1"),t("i2"),t("i3"),t("i4"))
    >> also add a SAVE method to save the order of each instruction?



MAYBE
- Add a general 'TIMEOUT: DELAY' settings
    Each instruction is done after DELAY after it was run (if not already done)

- Add a first trial that measures latencies?

    and the validation of the trial (finishedCallback)

DONE
- Make it possible to check for a subset of preloads (item-label-based)
    > also revise the preloading strategy:
                    right now, callback instructions (for instance) don't add their resources to 'toPreload'
                        (use controller's id instead)
    > How to you prelaod a subset?
            ["label", "PennController", CheckPreload("label1", "label2", ...)]

DONE
- Make compatible with GetItemsFrom / Rewrite GetItemsFrom as PennController.FeedItems
    [ var table = new PennController.Table("data.csv"[, "\t", "\"", fileringFunction]); ]
    [ table.setItem("Item"); ]      < extra-optional, smart detection
    [ table.setGroup("Group"); ]    < extra-optional, smart detection

                .keys("F", "J")
        )
    );
    > FUNCTION BECAUSE NEED TO DELAY INSTRUCTION'S CREATION

> Use chunk_includes to upload CSV table, then smart recognition of separator/quotations marks (if not specified)
> let lines = CHUNK_DICT[file].split('\n'); header = lines[0]; table = {};
    for (let h in header) table[h] = []; for (let l in lines) let row = lines[l].split;
    for (let cell in row) table[header[cell]].push(row[cell])
    > Add an if (lines[l].match("\t")) to exlude last, empty line
> CAN MAKE RECOGNITION AUTOMATIC (probe CHUNK_DICT for an entry that resembles a table)

DONE
- Add a Finish/Done/End/… Instruction to (prematurely) go to the next trial/to the end?

DONE: simply used Canvas
- Implement graphic module (Raphael? Outdated... > AllCharts' graphics?)
    add a 'draggable' option (events for drop?)     >> OR SIMPLY USE CANVAS? cf HTML5

DONE:   now only records the actual start
- Add something to check the ACTUAL start-playing of audio/video

DONE
- Add a t.selector instruction
    [DONE] can click on each instruction's element or use a key (how should the keys be set?)
    [DONE] can be just once or as many times
    [DONE] function to enable/disable
    [DONE] callback function with instruction?
    [DONE] t.selector( t("image1.png").id("i1") , t("image2.png").id("i2") ).key( "F", "J" ).save("first image", "second image")

DONE
- Add a way to identify the selected answer in SELECTOR, when shuffled
        > isn't it already the case?     < YES, and now also with ID

DONE
- Check .center() for ComplexInstr

DONE
- Rewrite AUDIOs so they behave the same as RADIOs
    they should record every event for themselves and user decides which to store with the SAVE method

DONE
    >   Re-appending audios to HTML recreates them(?) and FIRES CANPLAYTHROUGH AGAIN!   < Not anymore??
Now bind with 'one' rather than 'bind' (fired only once)

DONE
- Add _ in front of 'private' methods

DONE
- Add a CLEAR instruction (removes all visible elements from page)

DONE
- Rethink the way that Instructions preload their resources
    have an object whose keys are filenames/urls to (pre)load and values are arrays of Instructions/callback functions?
    will also take care of overriding (because no origin's defined when autopreload)

DONE
- See how running SetElement upon Run() for Audio (and Image?) affected t().j.css() and co
NB: now SPAN element for both Audio and Image, appending resource upon running

DONE
- Add the t.if function


NOTES
- The 'class' keyword is not recognized by early versions of browsers (e.g. my Safari)
    create a copy of the file with other methods?
    >> SOLVED with webpack (I think) but now problem with 'const'

- Unpredictible bugs when same variable name used multiple times (e.g. YT video playback starts)
