KAJSA'S BUG [**FIXED**]:
    SOME ELEMENTS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SPREADSHEET HAVE DIFFERENT LABELS
    IBEX'S INTERNAL MUNGGROUP + LATINSQUARE FUNCTIONS ARE SIMILAR TO FEEDITEMS:
    THEY GROUP THE ITEMS IN AN OBJECT, INDEXING THEM BY THEIR GROUP LABEL AND THEN FLATTEN THEM INTO AN ARRAY
    PROBLEM ARISES WHEN GROUP IN FIRST ROW OF FIRST FEEDITEMS IS DIFFERENT FROM FIRST ROW OF LATER FEEDITEMS
        > THE TWO FEEDITEMS ARE NOT ORDERED IN SYNC
        > + IF GROUP LABELS OF LATER FEEDITEMS ARE INTERMEDIATE AND # OF ROW IS NOT MODULO-CONSISTENT, IT SHIFTS THE LATIN SQUARE CONF
    SOLUTION?
        MODIFY-RUNNING-ORDER?
        NEED TO KEEP TRACK OF FEEDING (NOT ALL ITEMS GENERATED BY FEEDITEMS ARE PENNCONTROLLER ITEMS)
        PRE-PARSE THE TABLE?


BUG WITH FEEDITEMS DURING RUTGERS' WORKSHOP [**FIXED**]
    >> FIX IT!!

KNOWN BUGS/ERRORS/ISSUES
    - No support for OGG files on Safari 12
    - PennController does not work on Safari <12
    - Chrome & Safari require an interaction before the first audio is played


- fix voicerecorder with Chrome
    > certificate problem, fixing requires installing a certificate (tell Alex)

- add the drag'n'drop element (but what/when to log?)


- PRIORITY NOTES:                                                               [ Not happened in a while... ]
    >   Conflict between AUDIO and IFRAME??? > Sometimes
            >> MAYBE NOT DUE TO IFRAME, BUT PROBLEM MORE GENERALLY...?

- Fix what happens when no host and no zip provided


- Mouse
    > Save mouse location on click events
    > Make it possible to save any click < in Mouse instruction?
    PennController.mouse
                .settings.record("clickLocation", "clickInstruction", "hoverLocation", "hoverInstruction")
    PennController.mouse
                .waitHover( PennController.image("imgMyImage") )
                .waitClick( PennController.image("imgMyImage") )
    PennController.mouse
                .test.hover( PennController.image("imgMyImage") )

- Add a .background method for Canvas, to specify color/image background

- Add a .smartResize method for Canvas that updates the coordinates and sizes of the elements it contains?

- Add some way to LOOP instructions?
    > In particular, trigger an instruction EACH TIME a key is pressed (t.key("FJ").whenever( t("imgBeach").hide() )

- Write the Screen Instruction to prevent added elements from showing up
    > play with the _addElementTo function

- Add a MOUSE Instruction?
        > record position

- Integrate an instruction equivalent to the DashedSentence controller?

- Add parameters to the WAIT function of AUDIO
    on playstart or playend or stop < ?





IN PROGRESS     OBSOLETE
- Add a SHUFFLE method to ComplexInstr (already implemented in selector)        < not sure it's needed
    can pass indexes/instructions as parameters
    e.g.    t( t("image1.png").id("i1"), t("image2.png").id("i2"),   t("<br>"),   t("image3.png").id("i3"), t("image4.png").id("i4") ).shuffle(t("i1"),t("i2"),t("i3"),t("i4"))
    >> also add a SAVE method to save the order of each instruction?



MAYBE
- Add a general 'TIMEOUT: DELAY' settings
    Each instruction is done after DELAY after it was run (if not already done)

- Add a first trial that measures latencies?


// Below beta 0.4
DONE
    - Add options for scale.settings.log (last, first, etc.)
DONE
    - Also add a log entry when no choice was made
DONE
- Add a VIDEO Instruction

- Add 'controls' for YT (and Audio?)

DONE
- Add a Tooltip Instruction

DONE
- add youtube.settings.once
- add youtube.test.ended
- add button.test.clicked

DONE
- make 'defaults' local
    > use something like PennController.GlobalDefaults() for global defaults?
        (no way of telling from within defaultX whether it is called by PennController() or globally)
    > create 'header' and 'footer'
        can put defaults in header

DONE
- GetTable().setLabel, GetTable().setItem and GetTable().setGroup now return the table

DONE
- Fixed ResetPrefix (was testing type with "text" insteand of "string")

DONE
- added timer.test.ended

DONE
- scale buttons now save index if no label specified

DONE
- key.pressed() now works

DONE
- implemented timer.stop

DONE
- fixed timer.settings.callback (kept being frozen)


// Below: beta 0.2

DONE
- fixed a bug with typeof(element).match that called 'match' directly on 'element'(!?)

DONE
- add .test.is for function elements (tests return value)

DONE
- add .settings.once for Audio (and enable/disable)

DONE
- add .record to VoiceRecorder element (add something that tells signals recording is on)
- add .wait for VoiceRecorder (upon second press on red button)
- add .settings.once for VoiceRecorder (disable recorder after first recording's done)

DONE
- add a way to record fields from an HTML element 

DONE
- defaultText instead of text.defaults

DONE
- fix video automatically starting when first thing on first trial(?)

// Below: beta 0.1

DONE
- Add support for HTML files to the PennController.instruction() function (chunk_includes)
        > maybe rather a PennController.instruction.html()?

DONE (obsolete)
- Revise the SHOW method for Audio
    > currently changes property AFTER creation = no effect

DONE
- Add PLAY and PAUSE/STOP for Audio instructions (revise auto play then? Same for YT?)

DONE 
- Upload the recordings before __SendResults__
    and provide a function to generate a link to download the archive?

DONE
- Add a VoiceRecorder Instruction

DONE
- Create one copy of preloaded element PER INSTRUCTION

DONE
- Rewrite ComplexInstr to add its instructions UPON RUNNING, and only if they're not already part of #bod
[but not done]        > Maybe rename it GroupInstr?

DONE
- Save the timestamps of the first display of the page (handle preload) < preload = only thing not done yet (though first run)
    and the validation of the trial (finishedCallback)

DONE
- Make it possible to check for a subset of preloads (item-label-based)
    > also revise the preloading strategy:
                    right now, callback instructions (for instance) don't add their resources to 'toPreload'
                        (use controller's id instead)
    > How to you prelaod a subset?
            ["label", "PennController", CheckPreload("label1", "label2", ...)]
                    or
            CheckPreload("label1", "label2", ...)       +    shuffleSeq = seq("preload-label1", "label1", "preload-label2", "label2")

DONE
- Make compatible with GetItemsFrom / Rewrite GetItemsFrom as PennController.FeedItems
    [ var table = new PennController.Table("data.csv"[, "\t", "\"", fileringFunction]); ]
    [ table.setItem("Item"); ]      < extra-optional, smart detection
    [ table.setGroup("Group"); ]    < extra-optional, smart detection
    [ table.setLabel("Label"); ]    < extra-optional, smart detection
    PennController.FeedItems([table, ]
        (row) => PennController(
            p(row.question)
            ,
            p(row.delay)
            ,
            p.selector( p.image(row.target) , p.image(row.competitor) )
                .shuffle()
                .keys("F", "J")
        )
    );
    > FUNCTION BECAUSE NEED TO DELAY INSTRUCTION'S CREATION

> Use chunk_includes to upload CSV table, then smart recognition of separator/quotations marks (if not specified)
> let lines = CHUNK_DICT[file].split('\n'); header = lines[0]; table = {};
    for (let h in header) table[h] = []; for (let l in lines) let row = lines[l].split;
    for (let cell in row) table[header[cell]].push(row[cell])
    > Add an if (lines[l].match("\t")) to exlude last, empty line
> CAN MAKE RECOGNITION AUTOMATIC (probe CHUNK_DICT for an entry that resembles a table)

DONE
- Add a Finish/Done/End/… Instruction to (prematurely) go to the next trial/to the end?

DONE: simply used Canvas
- Implement graphic module (Raphael? Outdated... > AllCharts' graphics?)
    add a 'draggable' option (events for drop?)     >> OR SIMPLY USE CANVAS? cf HTML5

DONE:   now only records the actual start
- Add something to check the ACTUAL start-playing of audio/video

DONE
- Add a t.selector instruction
    [DONE] can click on each instruction's element or use a key (how should the keys be set?)
    [DONE] can be just once or as many times
    [DONE] function to enable/disable
    [DONE] callback function with instruction?
    [DONE] t.selector( t("image1.png").id("i1") , t("image2.png").id("i2") ).key( "F", "J" ).save("first image", "second image")

DONE
- Add a way to identify the selected answer in SELECTOR, when shuffled
        > isn't it already the case?     < YES, and now also with ID

DONE
- Check .center() for ComplexInstr

DONE
- Rewrite AUDIOs so they behave the same as RADIOs
    they should record every event for themselves and user decides which to store with the SAVE method

DONE
    >   Re-appending audios to HTML recreates them(?) and FIRES CANPLAYTHROUGH AGAIN!   < Not anymore??
Now bind with 'one' rather than 'bind' (fired only once)

DONE
- Something weird with ComplexInst and wait
- YT: do something about the iframe element

DONE
- Preloading
    DONE(?)     look deeper than the surface folder level for zips
    DONE        (re)append resources to HTML node before finishedCallback

DONE(?)
- Add specifics for MOVE (e.g. ComplexInstr > table)

DONE
- Add _ in front of 'private' methods

DONE
- Add a CLEAR instruction (removes all visible elements from page)

DONE
- Rethink the way that Instructions preload their resources
    have an object whose keys are filenames/urls to (pre)load and values are arrays of Instructions/callback functions?
    will also take care of overriding (because no origin's defined when autopreload)

DONE
- See how running SetElement upon Run() for Audio (and Image?) affected t().j.css() and co
NB: now SPAN element for both Audio and Image, appending resource upon running

DONE
- Add the t.if function


NOTES
- The 'class' keyword is not recognized by early versions of browsers (e.g. my Safari)
    create a copy of the file with other methods?
    >> SOLVED with webpack (I think) but now problem with 'const'

- Unpredictible bugs when same variable name used multiple times (e.g. YT video playback starts)
